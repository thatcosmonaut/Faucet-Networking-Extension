/**
 * Some considerations on using these state objects:
 *
 * There are two ways that control can enter these objects: either by the TcpSocket
 * they belong to or by callback handlers. If the object is called from the TcpSocket,
 * the common mutex of that socket must already be locked. Completion handlers always
 * lock that mutex before accessing any state of either the TcpSocket or the state object.
 *
 * The reference to the TcpSocket is stored as simple pointer here because we always
 * know that the object exists: If the call comes from the TcpSocket this is directly
 * obvious, and the completion handlers always contain a shared pointer reference
 * to the socket to prevent it from being destroyed before all asynchronous requests are
 * completed. We could use a shared pointer reference instead, but that would prevent
 * the socket from being destroyed at all if the last external reference to it is
 * destroyed.
